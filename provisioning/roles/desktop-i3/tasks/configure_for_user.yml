# Note: Due to Ansible's systemd module limitation, I don't use user scoped
# unit files ('systemctl --user'). Rather I use system scope with style
# '<unit-name>@<user>.service'. More specifically when become user is
# specified Ansible doesn't login as the given user, so that
# 'systemctl --user' would fail by not being able to connect user's dbus.
