# My way of Arching

My choice of Linux: Arch + i3. That combo requires some time to customize;
hone for efficiency.  On the other hand, I don't like to get attached to any
specific HW. Migration should be easy.

So, what is the solution? Automate and store my configurations here.

**Important:** 1st this will be more like a collection of manual notes. But,
hopefully, that will evolve when I have time.
